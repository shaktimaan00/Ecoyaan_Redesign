1. Redesigned the entire website: Based on the provided problem statement, I assumed that the goal was to improve the user interface and experience of the ecoyaan.com website.

2. Existing website was not visually appealing: I assumed that the current website had a poor design with harsh components, making it unattractive to users.

3. Introduced new UI elements: To enhance the website's aesthetics, I introduced new UI elements such as smoother transitions, modern typography, and visually appealing layouts.
